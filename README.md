### Tools:

### Schedule:
  Based on our little experiences in the past, we want to regard this project as our first opportunity to get into MongoDB and how Appstore and recommendation systems really works in industry. 
We'll code seperately to let everyone have a chance getting their hands on, but also discuss the problems we come across online together.  
Due to the Career Fair on Feb. 11th, we set Feb. 15th as the due of our first prototype. Then we'll discuss the improvement and furthur big-data related applications after, and eventually finish this first try on Feb. 20th.
